**Team**: *The Sheographers*

## About Us
We are a group of Geography graduate students here at UCSB!

## Motivation
To celebrate the beginning of the year, some of our friends wanted to get together to do a "polar bear swim." When we looked at available surfing applications, none of them made any comment about the level of bacteria in the water. The one surfer friend was especially concerned, wanting to do dawn patrol but worried about the recent rains and runoff.

## Idea
This application addresses the concern of **safe beach activity** by combining bacteria data with typical surf spot conditions such as wave height, wave direction, wave period, and sea surface temperature.

## Data
We used the following data sources for our application:
- wave height, direction, period and sea surface temperature: [Coastal Data Information Program](https://cdip.ucsd.edu/m/documents/data_access.html)
- water quality: [County of Santa Barbara](https://countyofsb.org/phd/oceanwatermonitoring/)
